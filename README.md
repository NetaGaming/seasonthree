# The Neta League

I built this site for a local League of Legends
league. Feel free to rip it off and use for your
own leagues.

## Setup

1. Get yourself an API key from Riot
1. Create an evironment variable with the name
   `RIOTAPIKEY_NETA` or anything really
1. Update the list of summoners at the top of
   `index.php` with any summoners you want to
	 look for

## Contributing

issue tracker.
